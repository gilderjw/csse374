1. DigitalBox line 17 & 18
a. What is the name of the class, method, and the line number range that contains the violation ?
DigitalBox constructor line 17 - 18
b. In your own words, describe how the selected code is violating the Law of Demeter.
It does not actually care about the dataLine, only about it's internal list of recievers
c. Show how you would rewrite the code so it doesn't violate the Law of Demeter.
Make an add method in DataLine so that the dataline is the only thing that cares about it's internal list
d. What design tradeoffs did you make in the coupling vs cohesion battle in your solution? Hint: you made tradeoffs
The cohesion is better now since it it more clear who cares about what
The coupling is worse since there are more surfaces between the two for communication
2. MpegEncoder recieved
a. What is the name of the class, method, and the line number range that contains the violation?
MpegEncoder.recieved() lines 13-20
b. In your own words, describe how the selected code is violating the Law of Demeter.
it just calls d.getContent() and then just manipulates the array returned
c. Show how you would rewrite the code so it doesn't violate the Law of Demeter.
If the function just took in a char array, it would not even have to know what Data had a getContent() method
d. What design tradeoffs did you make in the coupling vs cohesion battle in your solution ? Hint : you made tradeoffs
Coupling is better since MpegEncoder no longer needs to about getContent()
Cohesion is worse since the call to getContent() has to happen somewhere else
  2. AviEncoder recieved
  a. What is the name of the class, method, and the line number range that contains the violation ?
  AviEncoder.recieved() lines 13 - 26
  b. In your own words, describe how the selected code is violating the Law of Demeter.

  If the function just took in a char array, it would not even have to know what Data had a getContent() method
  d. What design tradeoffs did you make in the coupling vs cohesion battle in your solution? Hint: you made tradeoffs
  Coupling is better since AviEncoder no longer needs to about getContent()
