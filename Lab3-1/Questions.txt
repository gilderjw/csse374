Q1.
	Alice is using a simple factory
	The issue with her design is that if you want to add support for an operating system, you need to modify every method to add a case for the new os.

Q2.
	This is a factory method
	The issue with this design is that whenever I want to add a new componet, you will have to make a new factory for that label. Then, you will have to edit the existing code one level higher to keep track of all these factories
Q3.
	This is an abstract factory
	The issue with this design is that he split the factories by widget instead of by operating system. When you want to add a new operating system, you have go into every other widget factory and add a case for the new operating system. We also have to make every factory no matter what OS you are using. He also didn't really make the abstract factory abstract since he just added the switch statement in the top level anyway.
