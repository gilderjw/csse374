q1
	My strategy is to decorate the inputStream and outputStream to change the text before passing it on
q2
	It favors composition over inheritence because it uses an input and output string from somewhere else
	It also uses programming to an interface since the way it read does not matter as long as they extend InputStream
	It seperates what changes from what stays the same because to change how files are stored, you just need to change the stream code
q3
	it is at least a good framework when it comes to saving and reading. the rest is a black box so it is not well designed for me with what I have right now
